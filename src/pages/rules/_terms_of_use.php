    Contact information and Whois information must be filled correctly. Accounts with false information can be

        the scan copies of a passport or some other documents asked upon the registrar’s request within the shortest
        time, but not later than in 48 hours. If the demand is not fulfilled, the registrar is entitled to block the
        domain names and account until all circumstances are clarified.
</p>
<p>The Whois Protect service serves to conceal the real data of the domain name owner to protect him from unwanted postal mailing, telephone calls and other forms of advertising performed against the will of domain name’s owner. However, Whois Protect can not be a reason or an instrument for breaking the current law or rules of this service.</p>
<p>The registrar has a right to shut off the client’s service in 72 hours after such notification is sent to the user.</p>
