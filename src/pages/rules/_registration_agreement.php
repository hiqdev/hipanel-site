			<b>Definitions</b>

			societies under country codes relying upon the ISO 3166-1 standard.</p>

			<p><b>'National domains of other countries'</b> are .ะกะก, .LC, .ME, .TV domains.</p>
			<p><b>'Registry'</b> is a central database of the relevant international or national top-level domains with information on the registered domain names and DNS
			servers, other information required for the registration and the delegation of domains.</p>

			the domain name registration services.</p>
			<p><b>'Premium Domain'</b> is a domain reserved by the top-level domain administrator, top-level national domain administrator, registry operator or ICANN with

			<p><b>'Other Registrar'</b> is any legal entity accredited by ICANN or another authorized entity, including the top-level international domain Administrator,
			providing the domain name registration services and ensuring the transfer of the required information to the Registry.</p>
			<p><b>'Domain name registration'</b> is entering the information on the domain name to the Registry by the Registrar. The term registration, during which

			the possible abuse of rights of third parties relating to the selection and the use of the domain name and carries a risk of losses relating
			to the above-mentioned abuse.</p>
			<p><b>'Registration revocation'</b> (the release of the domain name) is the removal of the information on the domain name from the Registry.</p>
			<p><b>'Domain delegation'</b> is the placement and the storage of information on the domain name and the applicable domain name servers (DNS)
			on the root servers of the applicable top-level domains. The domain delegation with a list of DNS servers indicated by the Administrator or Partner
