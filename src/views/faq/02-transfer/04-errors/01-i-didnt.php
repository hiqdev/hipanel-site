<p>Check to what address the transfer authorization letter was sent.
    To do so, open domain control window and select the necessary domain from "My domains" tab.
    The address to which the transfer authorization letter was sent will be shown in the "Status" field.
    If you see contact@privacyprotect.org or similar address instead of your email, this means that you have not
    deactivated the
    Whois Protect service offered by your current registrar. Deactivate the Whois Protect and wait for 10-15 minutes.
    Then click on "send FOA again" link</p>

<p>If the status shows your email address, check your spam folder or wait for 5-7 minutes.</p>
